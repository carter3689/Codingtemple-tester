    About Me
  </h1>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Christie Ziegler. I come from a background in biology
    and I became interested in software development while working on a
    bioinformatics module at my last job. I'm also an artist and web development
    seems to be a good chance to integrate my interest in art and programming.

    My software development background
  </h2>
  <p>
    Last year I worked at the Field Museum, developing a bioinformatics tool for
    Python for working with evolutionary trees.
    The module I worked on allows scientists to load in a phylogenetic tree and
    plot it interactively. It also allows scientists to perform analyses on
    phylogenetic trees to learn more about how that group evolved. If you are
    interested in learning more, check out the <a href="http://rhr.github.io/ivy/" target="_blank">documentation!</a>
    <br><br>
    I enjoyed working on this project a lot, but unfortunately the funding ran
    out, so now I am looking for more practical experience so I can get a job
    doing full-stack web development. I am already familiar with Python so I
    am excited to learn Django. My ideal job would be working for a startup or
    other small company.
    <br><br>
    I enjoy programming because I like problem-solving. Taking a task and
    deciding how to break it down and solve it is like solving a giant puzzle,
    and puzzles are fun! And there's no better feeling than finally finishing
    a large project after days or weeks of work. You feel like you're on top
    of the world, at least until the next problem crops up!

    My art background
  </h2>
  <p>
    I have been drawing as a hobby for over ten years. I am familiar with
    Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, so I hope these experiences will help me
    when designing websites.
    <br><br>
    I mostly draw animals. They're interesting and it's always a challenge to
    learn to draw a new animal. I usually practice realism. Some people think
    realism is extremely challenging, but it's actually fairly straightforward
    if you use a reference photo. Even better if you took the reference photo
    yourself! When drawing realism, it's important not to get ahead of yourself
    and focus on rendering minute details. Beautifully rendered fur on a fox's
    face isn't going to count for much if the structure of the animal's head
    looks really weird! It's important to focus on large shapes. Make sure
    your areas of light and shadow are formed properly and the rest will fall
    into place. If all else fails, just look at your reference photo!
    <br><br>
    I also like to draw cartoons. I find stylized art to be more difficult
    than realism because you have to bring it upon yourself to decide how
    the image should look. While it's always good to use a reference image,
    you have to personally decide how you want to stylize the image. It can
    be difficult to decide what to do when your image doesn't look right when
    creating a stylized picture, but as always, practice makes perfect!
